Tutorial Demo
===============

Demo of various topics covered in my forge tutorials, namely IExtendedEntityProperties / Capabilities and custom inventories,
with updated network code, a working mana bar, an item that uses mana, and a custom player inventory that can
only hold the mana item. I may add more later.

Older versions of the demo are on different branches, e.g. 1.7.10 for that version.
